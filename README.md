# LoL Tomes

LoLTome is a Minecraft mod which adds new enchantments to the base game. I began developing this mod as a
form of practice to become familiar with Minecraft Forge's modding environment. In developing this mod, I primarily used 
concepts such as event handling,
vector mathematics 
and object-oriented design principles.

The mod contains the following enchantments:
- [x] Ashe
- [x] Blitzcrank
- [x] Mundo
- [x] Nasus
- [x] Nidalee
- [x] Olaf
- [x] Singed
- [x] Vayne
